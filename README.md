# Real-Time Bid Optimization Architecture Documentation

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the infrastructure architecture design for a real-time bid optimization application. The purpose is to provide a high-level overview of the desired architecture.

## 2. Purpose
The primary goal of this document is to evaluate the design of a scalable, efficient, and secure infrastructure architecture for a real-time bid optimization application. The design should address key challenges such as data ingestion, transformation, storage, real-time processing, and integration with external systems like Google Ads.

## 3. Scope
The scope of this task includes:

- **Data Ingestion:** Design the architecture for ingesting data from multiple sources, such as user interactions, market data, and historical bidding performance.
- **Data Transformation:** Define the process for transforming raw data into a format suitable for real-time processing and analysis.
- **Data Storage:** Design the storage architecture using Google Cloud BigQuery, ensuring scalability and low-latency access to data.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Develop an approach for real-time bid optimization, considering factors like latency, accuracy, and the ability to handle large volumes of data.
- **Integration with Google Ads:** Design the integration process to synchronize optimized bids with Google Ads in real-time.
- **Security and Compliance:** Address security measures, including data encryption, access control, and compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR).
- **Monitoring and Maintenance:** Propose a monitoring and maintenance strategy to ensure system reliability and performance.

## 4. Requirements

### 4.1 Technical Specifications
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** Use GCP services, such as BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Dataflow, and AI/ML tools.
- **Containerization:** Consider the use of containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) for deploying microservices.
- **Scalability:** Design for scalability to handle varying loads of bid requests and data ingestion.
- **Low-Latency:** Ensure low-latency processing to enable real-time bid adjustments.

### 4.2 Design Decisions
- **Technology Choices:** Justify the choice of technologies, tools, and design patterns.
- **Trade-Offs:** Highlight trade-offs between different design options.
- **Impact Analysis:** Consider the impact of the design on system performance, scalability, and cost.

### 4.3 Documentation
- **Architecture Diagram:** Provide a high-level architecture diagram that visualizes the system components and data flow.
- **Component Details:** Include detailed explanations of key components and their interactions.
- **Challenges & Mitigations:** Document potential challenges and the approach to mitigating them.
